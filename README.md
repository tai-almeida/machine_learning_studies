### supervisioned_learning folder
In this directory, I am introduced to Supervisioned Learning, exploring pre processing, classification, regression, association rules, clustering and other complementary topics.

Throughout this process, i go through the following main topics:
- Pre-processing with pandas and sklearn
    - Technichs to fill in inconsistent and/or missing data
    - Standardizing values to a same scale
    - LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder to treat cathegorical variables
    - Training and Testing data base spliting
 
**Model training by Classification:** 
I apply different classification technics into 2 projects:
    1: Prediction of whether or not a person will pay back their loan debt
    2: model to predict if someone makes above or bellow 50K a year

The technichs explored on the process were:
    - Bayesian Learning
    - Decision trees and Random Forest
    - Rule learning
    - kNN algorithms
