In this directory, I am introduced to Supervisioned Learning applied to 2 projects:
- 1: model to predict whether or not a person will pay back their loan debt
- 2: model to predict if someone make above or bellow 50K a year

**Throughout this process, i go through the following main topics**:
- Pre-processing with pandas and sklearn
    - Technichs to fill in inconsistent and/or missing data
    - Standardizing values to a same scale
    - LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder to treat cathegorical variables
    - Training and Testing data base spliting
